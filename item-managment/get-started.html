<h2>Create a New Item (for accounts without Quickbooks or other ERP integration)</h2>
<p>Now that we have set up our categories. It's time to start populating them with items. Under the Item Management tab, navigate to Items and click Add Item.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter UPC or create your personal short item name for easy search and classification. However, you can have both, your personal item name and UPC be displayed at the same time.</li>
  <li>Select a base unit in which you would like to track your inventory. When running inventory reports, the QTY on Hand will be displayed in these units.</li>
  <li>LodDepot lets you control what units are visible to the customers in catalog and web-stores.</li>

<h2>Create a New Item (for accounts with Quickbooks or other ERP integration)</h2>
<p>Now that we have set up our categories. It's time to start populating them with items. Under the Item Management tab, navigate to Items and click Add Item.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Item Name</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Description</strong> will be synced and managed through your ERP.</li>

When running inventory reports, the QTY on Hand will be displayed in these units.<br>If a base unit contains more than one item, indicate the amount of items included in the base unit.<br>e.g. If your base unit is a Case, which includes 10 items, than enter 10.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Item Units</h2>
<ol>
  <li>By setting the price of the base unit, the price of all other units will be recalculated automatically. Cost and price must be related to the base unit.</li>
  <li><strong>UNIT 1: Case</strong> By leaving the Price field, for our unit 1, empty, price of the case automatically got calculated based on pounds/case.</li>
  <li>If a base unit contains more than one item, indicate the amount of items included in the base unit.<br><strong>e.g.</strong> If your base unit is a Case, which includes 10 items, than enter 10.</li>
  <li><strong>UNIT 2: Pallet</strong>  In this unit we opted to give our customers a discount of 10% for purchasing this unit.&nbsp;<br>We could also set a fixed price for this particular unit, by unchecking the % box and entering the price.</li>
  <li>When your unit is represented by variable weight, then you indicate this by selecting this checkbox.</li>
</ol>
