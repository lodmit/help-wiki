<h1>Visibility Settings for Customers and Users</h1>
<h1>Black List (Items)</h1>
<p>Black List is the most basic way of hiding certain items from selected customers. To manage the Black List for an Item:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate <strong>Item Management → Items</strong></li>
  <li>Select an item and click <strong>More Information</strong> on the right-hand side of the screen</li>
  <li>Navigate to <strong>Black List tab → </strong>click<strong> Add </strong>(you can add multiple customers at the same time)</li>
  <li>Alternatively select a customer/s on the black list and click <strong>Delete</strong> to remove them from the black list</li>
</ol>

<h1>Access Groups (Categories)</h1>
<p>Access Group is a tool within LodDepot that allows you to customize visibility of item categories for:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users<br>i.e. Administrators, Salesmen, Managers and Order Pickers</li>
  <li>Customers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a Protected Category</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new or edit an existing category by following all the regular steps.</li>
  <li>A category will become a “protected category” only when you select an Access Group <mark class="marker-yellow">(ex.1)</mark>.</li>
  <li>This means that this category will only be visible to users with the same Access Group.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>You can have more than one category assigned to one access group</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Settings</h2>
<p>In this case, we want to give John the Salesman an ability to view several protected categories, including the protected category “Candies”, which we created in Step 1.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to Tools→User Management and select or create a user that should have access to the protected categories</li>
  <li>In Other Settings, select Access Groups which correspond with the protected categories that you want John to see <mark class="marker-yellow">(ex. 2)</mark></li>
</ol>
<p>After that you have two options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>John will be able to see <strong>ONLY the protected categories</strong> that you have selected → <mark class="pen-red"><strong>Do not check the box</strong></mark></li>
  <li>John will see the protected categories (Group A, B and C) <span class="text-big"><strong>+</strong></span><strong> all other unprotected categories</strong> (i.e. categories without an access group) → <mark class="pen-green"><strong>Check the box</strong></mark></li>
</ol>

<h2>Customer Settings</h2>
<p>In this case, we want to give a customer an ability to view protected categories.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to Customers Page and select a customer that should have access to the protected categories</li>
  <li>In Options, select Access Groups which correspond with the protected categories that you want this customer to see</li>
</ol>
<p>After that you have two options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The customer will be able to see <strong>ONLY the protected categories</strong> that you have selected → <mark class="pen-red"><strong>Do not check the box</strong></mark></li>
  <li>The customer will see the protected categories (Groups A, B and C) <span class="text-big"><strong>+</strong></span><strong> all other unprotected categories</strong> (i.e. categories without an access group) → <mark class="pen-green"><strong>Check the box</strong></mark></li>
</ol>

<h2>Case 1: Custom Items</h2>
<p>In this case we are selling branded packaging to two customers. We want the custom items specific to a client to not be visible by any other customers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Therefore, we assign an access group to the parent categories</li>
  <li><strong>Also, </strong>we select the corresponding access group in the ‘Options’ for that specific customer</li>
</ul>
